<P><B>Leadership - a definition</b>

<BR>The ability to get work done with and through others, while at the

same time winning their confidence, respect, loyalty and willing cooperation



<P>The first part of the definition could be a definition of management


<BR>The complete definition highlights the difference between simply managing

and being a leader



<P><B>Leadership</b>

<BR>Leaders influence many aspects of work, they:



<P>are the chief communicator of the group;

<BR>affect motivation by their behaviour; and

<BR>are responsible for the group's objectives being understood and achieved

<BR>As leadership is a critical influence of group performance,

<BR>it is worth understanding more about leadership and what makes an effective

leader



<P><B>Effective leadership</b>

<BR>Contrary to popular belief, no one is born a leader

<BR>But some people do have certain abilities that predispose them to developing

into a leader

<BR>Like public speaking, and many other skills, leadership can be learned

and developed



<P>While there is no agreed list of qualities that make a good leader


<BR>And different leadership styles suit different situations

<BR>It is widely agreed that leaders tend to have the following characteristics:



<P>Intelligence &ne; academic achievement

<BR>Social maturity = emotional maturity and a wide range of interests

<BR>Self-motivation and an achievement orientation

<BR>Self confidence and good communications skills



<P><B>Theories of leadership</b>

<BR>There has been a lot of research into styles of leadership

<BR>And the general conclusion is that a leader's concern for production

needs to be balanced with a concern for subordinates



<P>Robert Blake and Jane Mouton have devised the 'Management Grid'

<BR>This is a framework for identifying a range of leadership styles


<BR>Based on combinations of concern for people and concern for production



<P><B>&nbsp;The Blake and Mouton 'Management Grid'</b>

<BR>&nbsp;

<CENTER>&nbsp;<IMG SRC="m_grid.jpg" HEIGHT=249 WIDTH=520></CENTER>

Blake and Mouton argue that the 9.9 management style is the most effective

type of leadership behaviour

<BR>This approach will generally result in improved performance, low absenteeism

and turnover and high employee satisfaction



<P><B>Situational leadership</b>

<BR>We find that much of the recent research highlights the influence of

situational factors on which leadership style a manager should use



<P>Hersey and Blanchard's leadership theory says that a leader must chose

a style that is appropriate for the situation

<BR>ie. a manager leading an inexperienced group will need to spell out

what is required and closely supervise the work

<BR>a manager of an experienced team is probably better off getting out

of their way and just monitoring their progress




<P><B>Problem solving &amp; creativity</b>

<BR>You will recall that we said leadership is just one of many skills

that can be learned and developed

<BR>Well, so is problem solving and creativity

<BR>In fact, de Bono says, creativity is not natural, and we have to learn

it



<P>All through our life we subconsciously look for patterns which help

us predict the future

<BR>ie, things fall down, the sun rises in the east, you can't build a

house out of plasticine, etc

<BR>Over time we come to depend on these patterns,

<BR>and they tend to control and limit both our actions and our thinking



<P>de Bono recounts from his University days how he was newly arrived and

couldn't get back before the gates were closed at night

<BR>A companion told him how to climb over the two fences to get in after

hours

<BR>He climbed one high fence and jumped to the ground

<BR>He got up and climbed the next fence only to find himself outside again

- HOW?



<P>&nbsp;He had climbed over near a corner and climbed out again over the

nearest fence, which was the other outer wall


<BR>When he went around to the front gate, he discovered it had been open

all the time

<BR>He had just imagined that it was closed, because that's how it was

done normally



<P>de Bono talks about 'vertical thinking' and 'lateral thinking'



<P><B>Vertical thinking</b>

<BR>Vertical thinking is where we base our thought processes on our prior

knowledge, our experience and logic

<BR>Our thought processes are based on assumptions and follow a logical

sequence

<BR>This is the natural form of thinking

<BR>It constrains our creativity and ability to solve problems



<P>I was told the gate will be closed, so there is no point in checking

it



<P><B>Lateral thinking</b>

<BR>A set of systematic techniques used for changing concepts and perceptions

and generating new ones

<BR>More generally - exploring multiple possibilities and approaches instead

of pursuing a single approach



<P>The 'six hats' is one of de Bono's techniques




<P>I could check the gate before I jump the fence

<BR>Is this fence in front of me really the second fence I have to get

over?



<P>If we are innocent or ignorant of the 'done thing', we can produce very

creative solutions

<BR>Children and non-experts can sometimes produce creative solutions to

problems

<BR>If we are neither innocent or ignorant, we can employ lateral thinking

techniques to help us be creative



<P>There is a story of a group of women being shown around a war time factory

<BR>Someone mentioned a problem in the sharpening of carbon electrodes

used in search lights

<BR>One of the women suggested using a pencil sharpener

<BR>It worked!



<P>de Bono has provided the world with a number of techniques that can

be used to stimulate lateral thinking

<BR>The 'six hats' is not a lateral thinking technique per se, rather a

structured process for introducing lateral thinking into problem solving,

particularly in groups



<P><B>de Bono's 'Six Hats'</b>

<BR>de Bono describes the six hats as a 'game'

<BR>but you should be carefully not to underestimate the power in its simplicity

<BR>Many major international organisations use this technique for problem

solving




<P>&nbsp;Each 'hat' represents a perspective or way of thinking

<BR>They are metaphorical hats that a thinker can put on or take off to

indicate the type of thinking they are using

<BR>In a group we can ask members to 'put on' different hats in a sequence

to aide the problem solving process



<P>This can help overcome the problem of each group member adopting random

positions at random times

<BR>It also permits us to control people who insist of sticking to one

perspective (ie. negative) - we can ask them to assume a different hat



<P>Let's describe the various hats we can wear



<P><B>The white hat</b>

<BR>White is neutral

<BR>While wearing the white hat we ignore arguments and proposals,

<BR>we examine the facts, figures and information that we have, and

<BR>identify what information we don't have, and how we might get it



<P>What information do we have here?

<BR>What information is missing?

<BR>What information would we like to have?

<BR>How are we going to get the information?




<P><B>The red hat</b>

<BR>Red is for feelings, hunches and intuition

<BR>It permits people to put forward their feelings without the need for

apology, explanation or attempt to justify them

<BR>Intuition may be a composite judgement based on years of experience,

and

<BR>it can be valuable even if the reasons behind it cannot be spelled

out consciously



<P>Putting on my red hat, this is what I think about the project ...

<BR>My gut feeling is that it will not work

<BR>I don't like the way this is being done

<BR>My intuition tells me that prices will fall soon



<P><B>The black hat</b>

<BR>The black hat is the logical negative

<BR>It is the hat of caution &amp; critical judgement


<BR>It is the most used hat, and perhaps the most valuable hat, mistakes

may be disastrous

<BR>At the same time, it is very easy to overuse the black hat, it is easy

to kill creative ideas with early negativity



<P>The regulations do not permit us to do that

<BR>We do not have the production capacity to meet that order

<BR>When we tried a higher price the sales fell off

<BR>He has no experience in export management



<P><B>The yellow hat</b>

<BR>The yellow hat is for optimism and the logical positive view of things

<BR>It looks for feasibility and how something can be done

<BR>It looks for benefits, but they must be logically based



<P>That might work if we moved the production plant nearer to the customers

<BR>The benefit would come from repeat purchases

<BR>The high cost of energy would make everyone more energy efficient



<P><B>The green hat</b>

<BR>The green hat is for creative thinking, new ideas and additional alternatives

<BR>Putting on the green hat makes time and space for creative effort

<BR>This is were we engage in lateral thinking and other creative techniques



<P>We need some new ideas here

<BR>Are there any additional alternatives?

<BR>Could we do this in a different way?

<BR>Could there be another explanation?



<P><B>The blue hat</b>

<BR>The blue hat is the thinking overview or process control hat

<BR>It is usually used by the chairperson of the meeting:

<BR>it sets the agenda for thinking;

<BR>it suggests the next step for thinking;

<BR>it asks for summaries, conclusions and decisions



<P>We have spent far too much time looking for someone to blame


<BR>Could we have a summary of your views?

<BR>I think we should take a look at the priorities

<BR>I suggest we try some green hat thinking to get some new ideas



<P><B>de Bono's 'Six Hats'</b>

<BR>It is common for meetings to get bogged down in arguments where people

take positions and defend them to the death

<BR>The 6 hats is a cooperative tool rather than a adversarial tool

<BR>In a normal meeting, it is easy for someone not to look for positives

if they do not support an idea - the 6 hats technique challenges participants

to see all sides



<P>Some people see the downside in everything

<BR>The 6 hats technique offers them ample opportunity for black hat thinking,

<BR>but challenges them to think in other ways as well

<BR>It is important the hats are not categories or labels for people

<BR>rather than limiting people, the aim of the 6 hats is to get the thinker

to use all 6 hats



<P>Some times it is possible to put together a sequence of hats that will

assist in thinking productively about some matter



<P>The actual order will vary with the situation,

<BR>but for a new matter, the sequence might be:




<P><B>The six hats - for a new problem</b>

<UL>

<LI>

White - to get information;</LI>



<LI>

Green - for ideas and proposals;</LI>


<LI>

Yellow followed by Black on each alternative - to evaluate alternatives;</LI>



<LI>

Red - to assess feelings at this point;</LI>



<LI>

Blue - to decide what thinking to do next</LI>

</UL>





<P><B>For a well known idea</b>

<BR>For a well known proposal, the sequence of hats might run:

<UL>

<LI>

red;</LI>



<LI>

yellow;</LI>



<LI>

black;</LI>



<LI>

green (to overcome negative points);</LI>



<LI>

white; and then</LI>



<LI>

blue</LI>

</UL>
